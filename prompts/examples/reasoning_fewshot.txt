Example 1:
Input: If all roses are flowers and some flowers fade quickly, can we conclude that some roses fade quickly?
Reasoning: All roses are flowers, but we do not know if the subset of flowers that fade quickly includes roses.
Output: No.

Example 2:
Input: If Ali is older than Sara, and Sara is older than Rana, who is the oldest?
Reasoning: Older-than is a transitive relation: Ali > Sara > Rana.
Output: Ali.

Example 3:
Input: A box has 3 red balls and 5 blue balls. If one ball is picked randomly, which color is more likely?
Reasoning: 5 > 3, so probability of blue is higher.
Output: Blue.
